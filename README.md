# ECE178-FPGAEthernetComm

Abstract

A firewall can be defined as a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic with the ability to permit or block the flow of data based on a set of given security rules. The DE2-115 board has ethernet capabilities that allow for high-speed transmission of data. The FPGA board has two ethernet ports that can be used to implement a firewall between two connected devices.

The intent of this project is to have two devices that will transmit sets of data between themselves, and to design and program a system on the DE2-115 FPGA board that will be able to examine data transmitted between devices and block certain data based on rules specified by the team. Data could be restricted based on pre-determined patterns of data, as well as identification from the transmitting devices.
